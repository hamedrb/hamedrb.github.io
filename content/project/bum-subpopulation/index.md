    Bumetanide, a promising candidate for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatment, has been evaluated in two phase III clinical trials to assess its efficacy and safety. These trials were international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled studies involving approximately 50 centers across 13 countries. The studies targeted two distinct age groups: children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years (Study 1) and younger children aged 2 to 6 years (Study 2). Participants received either Bumetanide oral liquid formulation or a placebo twice daily (BID) over a six-month period. Despite strong prior evidence from phase II trials indicating potential benefits, the phase III trials did not meet success criteria. However, clinicians observed that Bumetanide was effective in a subset of patients. This project aims to identify responder subpopulations using baseline clinical parameters and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to refine patient selection criteria for future trials.

    <div class="description">
    ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 67 million individuals worldwide, with a rising global prevalence of around 2%. It is characterized by persistent deficits in communication, social interaction, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Despite extensive research efforts and substantial financial investment, effective pharmacological treatments for ASD remain limited. Bumetanide has shown promise in nine double-blind, randomized phase II clinical trials involving over 1,000 children worldwide, yet it failed to meet phase III success criteria. The heterogeneity of ASD may have played a critical role in this failure, necessitating a personalized treatment approach to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from the therapy.

    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Rationale:</b><br>
        To address the challenge of ASD heterogeneity, we leveraged machine learning techniques to reanalyze the phase III clinical trial data. Our approach focused on identifying clinical markers that differentiate responders from non-responders at baseline.
        <p>
        <b>Population:</b><br>
        The study population consisted of subjects who were selected for randomization in the phase III clinical trials and received either Bumetanide or a placebo. These individuals served as the basis for our ML-driven analysis, allowing us to extract patterns that define treatment responders.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Methods:</b><br>
        Using advanced ML algorithms, we analyzed baseline clinical parameters to uncover patterns associated with treatment response. This data-driven approach enabled us to stratify ASD patients into subpopulations with higher likelihoods of benefiting from Bumetanide treatment. By integrating various clinical and demographic factors, we aimed to establish robust and generalizable predictive models for ASD treatment response.

    <div class="description">
    Our analysis identified several responder subpopulations, comprising between 20% and 40% of the phase III study cohort. These findings hold significant promise, as they pave the way for a more personalized approach to ASD treatment, improving patient outcomes by targeting those most likely to benefit. However, due to ongoing patent processes, further details on specific methodologies and results cannot yet be disclosed.

    Our work represents a groundbreaking step in ASD treatment, offering a novel, precision medicine approach to an otherwise heterogeneous disorder. By integrating AI-driven analytics with clinical trial data, we have developed a method to refine patient selection, ensuring more effective treatment strategies. This innovation holds transformative potential, paving the way for personalized ASD therapies and advancing the field of neurodevelopmental disorder research.

    To ensure the reliability and clinical applicability of our findings, further validation is required. Machine learning-driven studies must be rigorously tested to rule out correlations arising by chance. Consequently, a new phase II/III trial is needed, incorporating refined inclusion criteria based on the subpopulation parameters identified in our study. This next phase will validate our predictive model and further establish Bumetanide as a targeted treatment for ASD.
