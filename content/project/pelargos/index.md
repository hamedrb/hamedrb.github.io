        Pelargos project, powered by artificial intelligence, has two key goals: developing a cutting-edge medical device for the early prognosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in newborns and identifying new ASD biomarkers. By leveraging data routinely collected during pregnancy follow-ups, childbirth, and the first days of life, the device aims to enable timely interventions, improving outcomes for children at risk. Simultaneously, the identification of biomarkers will open new research pathways, shedding light on the unknown underlying mechanisms and early indicators of ASD, fostering innovation in both clinical and scientific fields.

        ASD, characterized by persistent deficits in communication and social interactions, along with restricted and repetitive behaviors, affects approximately 67 million individuals worldwide. The global prevalence of ASD is estimated to be around 2% and is steadily increasing. In the absence of an approved pharmacological treatment, symptom management relies on compensatory behavioral therapies, such as TEACCH and ABA, which are most effective when started early, during the peak of brain plasticity, before 2‚Äì3 years of age. Unfortunately, the current average age of diagnosis for these complex and heterogeneous disorders remains between 4 and 5 years, preventing timely interventions at the most critical developmental period. <b>Early identification of children with ASD thus remains a significant global public health challenge.</b>

      <div class="title">Approach</div>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        <b>Rationale:</b><br>
        Our approach is based on a hypothesis, supported by clinical and histological evidence, that ASD originates in the perinatal period. According to this hypothesis, it may be possible to detect ASD markers through biological and ultrasound measurements routinely collected in pregnancy follow-ups and maternity clinics, from the first trimester through the first days after birth.
        <p>
        <b>Population:</b><br>
        To explore this, we conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort of 63 children diagnosed with ASD at ages 2‚Äì5 years, along with an age-matched control group of 189 neurotypical (NT) children, all born in 2012‚Äì2013 at the Hospital of the University of Limoges in France.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Classification:</b><br>
        Given the large number of variables and the complex, multivariate, and poorly understood relationships among them, we employed advanced statistical tools to identify distinguishing patterns between NT and ASD groups. A supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm, XGBoost, was trained to classify newborns into ASD and NT categories. In line with ethical considerations, the model was designed to maintain a false positive rate below 5% while maximizing sensitivity. To ensure the classifier's robustness and generalizability, as well as to optimize hyperparameters, a nested cross-validation (CV) approach was utilized. The variables most influential in the classifier's decisions were identified using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Statistical tests and modelling:</b><br>
        Simultaneously, traditional statistical hypothesis tests were applied to detect significant differences in the distributions of collected variables between NT and ASD groups. Additionally, we analyzed longitudinal developmental trajectories of head circumference (HC) growth in fetuses using statistical models such as ANCOVA and quadratic mixed-effect models. These analyses aimed to explore whether the megalencephalic brains observed in children and adolescents with ASD could originate during fetal development.
        </p>
        <p>
        This multi-faceted approach integrates advanced machine learning with conventional statistical methods to uncover potential biomarkers and developmental patterns associated with ASD.

          <b>Trained ASD classifier:</b><br>
          The primary outcome of the project is a trained classifier, which serves as the core component of the Pelargos medical device. Regarding our training strategy, aimed at maintaining the false positive rate below 5% while maximizing sensitivity, the performance of the classifier, measured by a CV technique, is summerized in the table below:

          <b>Interpretation of the classifier's output:</b><br>
          The SHAP analysis provided valuable insights into the classification results, identifying variables that significantly influence the classifier's performance. From a clinical perspective, these variables hold potential as biomarkers for ASD. Below are the 5 most impactful variables:
          {{< figure src="Pelargos-results-shap.png" alt="Figure: SHAP analysis" >}}
          Each row represents a variable, with a point colored according to its corresponding value for each subject. The color map illustrates how the impact of each variable varies with its values. Values on the positive (orange) or negative (green) side of the SHAP distribution correspond to classifications of ASD or NT, respectively. The following table presents the variables, along with the value ranges that drive the classifier toward an ASD diagnosis.

          <b>Statistical hypothesis testing:</b><br>
          Statistical hypothesis testing identified 5 variables with significant differences between the ASD and NT groups, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for ASD.

          <b>Analysis of fetal developmental trajectories</b><br>
          Through the analysis of fetal developmental trajectories, we identified a distinct subgroup of ASD subjects with significantly larger head circumferences (HCs) compared to both age-matched neurotypical (NT) peers and other ASD subjects during the second (T2) and third trimesters(T3), as well as prior to birth.
