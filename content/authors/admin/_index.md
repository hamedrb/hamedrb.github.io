      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As a data scientist specializing in biomedical and clinical data analysis, I bring expertise in uncovering insights from complex, multi-modal datasets to advance medical research and therapeutic strategies. My work involves analyzing microscopic images of animal tissues, MR images of human tissues, and clinical data from patient records. Using a range of analytical tools, including statistical testing, machine learning, and predictive modeling, I strive to identify meaningful patterns that can detect pathologies and anticipate treatment outcomes. With a focus on translating data into actionable insights, I am dedicated to supporting precision medicine and enhancing healthcare solutions.
