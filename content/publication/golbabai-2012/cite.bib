 abstract = {In this paper, a meshfree method based on radial basis functions (RBFs) is developed to approximate the eigenvalues of Stokes equations in primitive variables in a square domain. To avoid the inaccuracy near the boundaries, the collocation on boundary technique is applied. This approach leads to more accurate solutions in comparisons with finite element methods. To investigate the role of shape parameter in approximation, some discussion on shape parameter is presented. Â© 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
