abstract: In this paper, a meshfree method based on radial basis functions (RBFs)
  is developed to approximate the eigenvalues of Stokes equations in primitive variables
  in a square domain. To avoid the inaccuracy near the boundaries, the collocation
  on boundary technique is applied. This approach leads to more accurate solutions
  in comparisons with finite element methods. To investigate the role of shape parameter
  in approximation, some discussion on shape parameter is presented. Â© 2012 Published
