abstract: Shape parameters play an important role in radial basis function (RBF) approximations.
  Therefore, the choice of them is an active field in numerical analysis research.
  In this paper, first we review the available strategies in the literature for selecting
  shape parameters. Then, we introduce an alternative approach called hybrid strategy
  for scaling the RBFs. This strategy is constructed based on the advantages of the
  older ones and discards their disadvantages. The efficiency of the new strategy
  is demonstrated by comparing the effects of different strategies on approximating
  the eigenvalues of ordinary and partial differential equations with different boundary
  conditions. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
