abstract: The rate of cesarean section (CS) delivery has steadily increased over the
  past decades despite epidemiological studies reporting higher risks of neonatal
  morbidity and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, little is known about the immediate
  impact of CS birth on the brain, hence the need of experimental studies to evaluate
  brain parameters following this mode of delivery. Using the solvent clearing method
  iDISCO and 3D imaging technique, we report that on the day of birth, whole-brain,
  hippocampus, and striatum volumes are reduced in CS-delivered as compared to vaginally-born
  mice, with a stronger effect observed in preterm CS pups. These results stress the
  impact of CS delivery, at term or preterm, during parturition and at birth. In contrast,
  cellular activity and apoptosis are reduced in mice born by CS preterm but not term,
  suggesting that these early-life processes are only impacted by the combination
  of preterm birth and CS delivery.
