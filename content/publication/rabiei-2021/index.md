abstract: The recent definition of fractional Brownian motions on surfaces has raised
  the statistical issue of estimating the Hurst index characterizing these models.
  To deal with this open issue, we propose a method which is based on a spectral representation
  of surfaces built upon their Laplace-Beltrami operator. This method includes a first
  step where the surface supporting the motion is recovered using a mean curvature
  flow, and a second one where the Hurst index is estimated by linear regression on
  the motion spectrum. The method is evaluated on synthetic surfaces. The interest
  of the method is further illustrated on some fetal cortical surfaces extracted from
  magnetic resonance images as a means to quantify the brain complexity during the
  gestational age.
