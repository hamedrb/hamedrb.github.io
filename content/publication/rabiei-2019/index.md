abstract: The human cerebral cortex is a highly folded structure that can be modeled
  by a surface extracted in vivo from magnetic resonance imaging data. The folding
  complexity of this surface has been shown to be a relevant biological measurement,
  often estimated locally and referred to by the term “gyrification index” (GI). There
  is, however, no universal agreement on the notion of surface complexity and various
  methods have been presented that evaluate different aspects of cortical folding.
  In this chapter, we show how a local spectral analysis of the cortical surface mean
  curvature can address this problem and provide two well-defined gyrification indices.
  Specifically, we extended the concept of graph windowed Fourier transform to the
  framework of surfaces modeled by triangular meshes. The intrinsic nature of the
  method allows us to compute the folding complexity at different spatial scales.
  We show that our approach overcomes a major flaw in other more classical GI estimators,
  namely the impossibility to differentiate deep cortical folds from shallower but
  more oscillating ones. We applied our method on synthetic data as well as on a database
  of 124 healthy adult subjects and showed that it verifies important properties and
  capture important aspects of cortical gyrification. A comparison with other GI definitions
  is also provided.
