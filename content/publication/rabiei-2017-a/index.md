abstract: Gyrification index (GI) is an appropriate measure to quantify the complexity
  of the cerebral cortex. There is, however, no universal agreement on the notion
  of surface complexity and there are various methods in literature that evaluate
  different aspects of cortical folding. In this paper, we give two intuitive interpretations
  on folding quantification based on the magnitude and variation of the mean curvature
  of the cortical surface. We then present a local spectral analysis of the mean curvature
  to introduce two local gyrification indices that satisfy our interpretations. For
  this purpose, the graph windowed Fourier transform is extended to the framework
  of surfaces discretized with triangular meshes. An adaptive window function is also
  proposed to deal with the intersubject cortical size variability. The intrinsic
  nature of the method allows us to compute the degree of folding at different spatial
  scales. Our experiments show that while more classical surface area-based GIs may
  fail at differentiating deep folds from very convoluted ones, our spectral GIs overcome
  this issue. The method is applied to the cortical surfaces of 124 healthy adult
  subjects of OASIS database and average gyrification maps are computed and compared
  with other GI definitions. In order to illustrate the capacity of our method to
  capture and quantify important aspects of gyrification, we study the relationship
  between brain volume and cortical complexity, and design a scaling analysis with
  a power law model. Results indicate an allometric relation and confirm the well-known
  observations that larger brains are more folded. We also perform the scaling analysis
  at the vertex level to investigate how the degree of folding varies locally with
  the brain volume. Results reveal that in our healthy adult brain database, cortical
  regions which are the least folded on average show an increased folding complexity
  when brain size increases.
