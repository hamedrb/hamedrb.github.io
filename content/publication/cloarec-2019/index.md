abstract: We report that the apical dendrites of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons
  are increased during labor and birth in the valproate model of autism but not in
  control animals. Using the iDISCO clearing method, we show that hippocampal, especially
  CA3 region, and neocortical volumes are increased and that the cerebral volume distribution
  shifts from normal to lognormal in valproate-treated animals. Maternal administration
  during labor and birth of the NKCC1 chloride transporter antagonist bumetanide,
  which reduces [Cl âˆ’ ] i levels and attenuates the severity of autism, abolished
  the neocortical and hippocampal volume changes and reduced the whole-brain volume
  in valproate-treated animals. These results suggest that the abolition of the oxytocin-mediated
  excitatory-to-inhibitory shift of GABA actions during labor and birth contributes
  to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders by stimulating growth during a
  vulnerable period.
