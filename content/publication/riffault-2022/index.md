abstract: The complex organization of brain regions during development requires a
  three-dimensional approach to facilitate the visualization and quantification of
  dynamic changes taking place throughout this important period. Using the tissue
  clearing method combined with immunohistochemistry, three-dimensional (3D) lightsheet
  microscopy and a multiresolution registration technique, we provide the first 3D
  atlases of the main cholinergic (CH) and catecholaminergic (CA) systems in the mouse
  brain from embryonic day 12 (E12) to post-natal day 8 (P8). We report that in several
  brain structures, there is a logarithmic scale increase of choline acetyltransferase
  and tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from E18 to P8. In addition, a detailed
  voxel-wise analysis revealed abrupt modifications in the developmental trajectory
  of many brain structures during the transition from E18 to P0. Our atlases will
  not only facilitate developmental studies aimed at quantitatively determining the
  fate of CH or CA neurons in utero but also be used as an anatomical reference to
  quantify other neuronal populations present in the annotated regions. In the future,
  these maps will be a reliable tool to study developmental malformations associated
  with neurological and psychiatric disorders.
