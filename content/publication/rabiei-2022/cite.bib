 abstract = {The Gyrification Index (GI) quantifies the amount of folding of a cortical surface. In this paper, we show the efficiency of spectral analysis to perform such a task, and in particular we explain how the graph windowed Fourier transform can be used as a tool to define new GIs with multiscale properties. We propose two different GIs and study their effect on a set of subjects whose cortical surfaces are modeled with triangular meshes.},
