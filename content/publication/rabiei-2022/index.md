abstract: The Gyrification Index (GI) quantifies the amount of folding of a cortical
  surface. In this paper, we show the efficiency of spectral analysis to perform such
  a task, and in particular we explain how the graph windowed Fourier transform can
  be used as a tool to define new GIs with multiscale properties. We propose two different
  GIs and study their effect on a set of subjects whose cortical surfaces are modeled
  with triangular meshes.
