abstract: 'To identify newborns at risk of developing ASD and to detect ASD biomarkers
  early after birth, we compared retrospectively ultrasound and biological measurements
  of babies diagnosed later with ASD or neurotypical (NT) that are collected routinely
  during pregnancy and birth. We used a supervised machine learning algorithm with
  a cross-validation technique to classify NT and ASD babies and performed various
  statistical tests. With a minimization of the false positive rate, 96% of NT and
  41% of ASD babies were identified with a positive predictive value of 77%. We identified
  the following biomarkers related to ASD: sex, maternal familial history of auto-immune
  diseases, maternal immunization to CMV, IgG CMV level, timing of fetal rotation
  on head, femur length in the 3rd trimester, white blood cell count in the 3rd trimester,
  fetal heart rate during labor, newborn feeding and temperature difference between
  birth and one day after. Furthermore, statistical models revealed that a subpopulation
  of 38% of babies at risk of ASD had significantly larger fetal head circumference
  than age-matched NT ones, suggesting an in utero origin of the reported bigger brains
  of toddlers with ASD. Our results suggest that pregnancy follow-up measurements
  might provide an early prognosis of ASD enabling pre-symptomatic behavioral interventions
  to attenuate efficiently ASD developmental sequels.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We retrospectively analyzed routine ultrasound and biological measurements collected during pregnancy and at birth from babies later diagnosed with ASD or identified as neurotypical, aiming to detect early biomarkers and identify newborns at risk.
