abstract = {The complex organization of brain regions during development requires a three-dimensional approach to facilitate the visualization and quantification of dynamic changes taking place throughout this important period. Using the tissue clearing method combined with immunohistochemistry, three-dimensional (3D) lightsheet microscopy and a multiresolution registration technique, we provide the first 3D atlases of the main cholinergic (CH) and catecholaminergic (CA) systems in the mouse brain from embryonic day 12 (E12) to post-natal day 8 (P8). We report that in several brain structures, there is a logarithmic scale increase of choline acetyltransferase and tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from E18 to P8. In addition, a detailed voxel-wise analysis revealed abrupt modifications in the developmental trajectory of many brain structures during the transition from E18 to P0. Our atlases will not only facilitate developmental studies aimed at quantitatively determining the fate of CH or CA neurons in utero but also be used as an anatomical reference to quantify other neuronal populations present in the annotated regions. In the future, these maps will be a reliable tool to study developmental malformations associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {The rate of cesarean section (CS) delivery has steadily increased over the past decades despite epidemiological studies reporting higher risks of neonatal morbidity and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, little is known about the immediate impact of CS birth on the brain, hence the need of experimental studies to evaluate brain parameters following this mode of delivery. Using the solvent clearing method iDISCO and 3D imaging technique, we report that on the day of birth, whole-brain, hippocampus, and striatum volumes are reduced in CS-delivered as compared to vaginally-born mice, with a stronger effect observed in preterm CS pups. These results stress the impact of CS delivery, at term or preterm, during parturition and at birth. In contrast, cellular activity and apoptosis are reduced in mice born by CS preterm but not term, suggesting that these early-life processes are only impacted by the combination of preterm birth and CS delivery.},

One of the most popular meshless methods is constructed by radial kernels as basis called radial basis function method. It has a unique feature which affects significantly on accuracy and stability of approximation: existence of a free parameter known as shape parameter that can be chosen constantly or variably. Several techniques for selecting a variable shape parameter have been presented in the older works. Our study focuses on investigating the deficiency of these techniques and we introduce two new alternative strategies called hybrid shape parameter and binary shape parameter strategies based on the advantages of older studies. The proposed approaches produce the more accurate results as shown in numerical results where they are compared with random shape parameter strategy for interpolating one-dimensional and two- dimensional functions as well as in approximating the solution of Poisson equation.},

abstract = {Gyrification index (GI) is an appropriate measure to quantify the complexity of the cerebral cortex. There is, however, no universal agreement on the notion of surface complexity and there are various methods in literature that evaluate different aspects of cortical folding. In this paper, we give two intuitive interpretations on folding quantification based on the magnitude and variation of the mean curvature of the cortical surface. We then present a local spectral analysis of the mean curvature to introduce two local gyrification indices that satisfy our interpretations. For this purpose, the graph windowed Fourier transform is extended to the framework of surfaces discretized with triangular meshes. An adaptive window function is also proposed to deal with the intersubject cortical size variability. The intrinsic nature of the method allows us to compute the degree of folding at different spatial scales. Our experiments show that while more classical surface area-based GIs may fail at differentiating deep folds from very convoluted ones, our spectral GIs overcome this issue. The method is applied to the cortical surfaces of 124 healthy adult subjects of OASIS database and average gyrification maps are computed and compared with other GI definitions. In order to illustrate the capacity of our method to capture and quantify important aspects of gyrification, we study the relationship between brain volume and cortical complexity, and design a scaling analysis with a power law model. Results indicate an allometric relation and confirm the well-known observations that larger brains are more folded. We also perform the scaling analysis at the vertex level to investigate how the degree of folding varies locally with the brain volume. Results reveal that in our healthy adult brain database, cortical regions which are the least folded on average show an increased folding complexity when brain size increases.},

abstract = {Surface shape complexity is a morphological characteristic of folded surfaces. In this thesis, we aim at developing some spectral methods to quantify this feature of the human cerebral cortex reconstructed from structural MR images. First, we suggest some properties that a standard measure of surface complexity should possess. Then, we propose two clear definitions of surface complexity based on surface bending properties. To quantify these definitions, we extended the recently introduced graph windowed Fourier transform to mesh model of surfaces. Through some experiments on synthetic surfaces, we show that our curvature-based measurements overcome the classic surface area-based ones which may not distinguish deep folds from oscillating ones with equal area. The proposed method is applied to a database of 124 healthy adult subjects. We also define the surface complexity by the H{\"{o}}lder regularity of fractional Brownian motions defined on manifolds. Then, for the first time, we develop a spectral-regression algorithm to quantify the H{\"{o}}lder regularity of a given fractional Brownian surface by estimating its Hurst parameter H. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of simulated fractional Brownian spheres. Moreover, assuming the cerebral cortex is a fractional Brownian surface, the proposed algorithm is applied to estimate the Hurst parameters of a set of 14 fetal cerebral cortices.},

abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is a highly folded structure that can be modeled by a surface extracted in vivo from magnetic resonance imaging data. The folding complexity of this surface has been shown to be a relevant biological measurement, often estimated locally and referred to by the term “gyrification index” (GI). There is, however, no universal agreement on the notion of surface complexity and various methods have been presented that evaluate different aspects of cortical folding. In this chapter, we show how a local spectral analysis of the cortical surface mean curvature can address this problem and provide two well-defined gyrification indices. Specifically, we extended the concept of graph windowed Fourier transform to the framework of surfaces modeled by triangular meshes. The intrinsic nature of the method allows us to compute the folding complexity at different spatial scales. We show that our approach overcomes a major flaw in other more classical GI estimators, namely the impossibility to differentiate deep cortical folds from shallower but more oscillating ones. We applied our method on synthetic data as well as on a database of 124 healthy adult subjects and showed that it verifies important properties and capture important aspects of cortical gyrification. A comparison with other GI definitions is also provided.},

We used a supervised machine learning algorithm with a cross-validation technique to classify NT and ASD babies and performed various statistical tests. With a minimization of the false positive rate, 96{\%} of NT and 41{\%} of ASD babies were identified with a positive predictive value of 77{\%}. We identified the following biomarkers related to ASD: sex, maternal familial history of auto-immune diseases, maternal immunization to CMV, IgG CMV level, timing of fetal rotation on head, femur length in the 3rd trimester, white blood cell count in the 3rd trimester, fetal heart rate during labor, newborn feeding and temperature difference between birth and one day after. Furthermore, statistical models revealed that a subpopulation of 38{\%} of babies at risk of ASD had significantly larger fetal head circumference than age-matched NT ones, suggesting an in utero origin of the reported bigger brains of toddlers with ASD. Our results suggest that pregnancy follow-up measurements might provide an early prognosis of ASD enabling pre-symptomatic behavioral interventions to attenuate efficiently ASD developmental sequels.},
